# DEWNA_SupplementaryTables
Supplementary Tables S1-S7 for DEWNA

#### Table S1. All proteins identified in A549 cells with cisplatin-induced damage across 8 time points (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, and 36 h) (Online supplementary file).
#### Table S2. The the activity profiling of different clusters over the 8 time points (Online supplementary file).
#### Table S3. Entropy weighted expression table of protein hubs derived from the A549 cells with cisplatin-induced damage across 8 time points (Online supplementary file).
#### Table S4. All KEGG enrichment results of those protein hubs in Table S3 (Online supplementary file).
#### Table S5. The table of activity values and reporter scores of all KEGG pathways (Online supplementary file).
#### Table S6. The entropy-weighted protein expression table (Online supplementary file).
#### Table S7. The results encompass all proteins involved in the enriched pathways, as determined by the generalized reporter score-based analysis of the entropy-weighted protein expression table (Online supplementary file).
